# EnglishDictionary

Hello there,

This is very basic simulation of a word search in an English dictionary.
I have the data with words and their meaning in a JSON file named data.json.

This program is a little smarter than just a simple word search.
If word is found in the dictionary it returns its meaning(s).
Else it recommends user the closest matching word in the dictionary.
